# Grade Calculator App
 I created a Grade Calculator App using Object-Oriented Programming and Event-Driven Programming in Python. 
 Utilizes tkinter for the GUI creation and sqlite3 for the SQL database creation, manipulation, and storage. 
 This application allows users to input their semesters, and their grading schemes. 
 Users can then put in their assignment grades and track their progress as time continues. 
 It contains useful features such as allowing for the testing of assignment grades. Where the user can input a test grade in a certain assignment category and see the impact on both the section grade as well as the final grade in real time.
 It also contains a feature that allows students to say how many points are left in a certain category and their desired final grade, and they will be shown the score that they need to receive for those points in order to obtain that grade.

In the future, I would like to improve the visual aesthetics of the program, as well as include a predictive model that can predict the probability of a user getting a certain grade in the class.
